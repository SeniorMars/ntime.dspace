# Corollary 7.2: #3-SAT in space `O(m/√log m)`

Corollary 7.2 (paper `cor:3sat`): *given a 3-CNF formula with `m ≥ 2` clauses in which every
variable occurs, the number of its satisfying assignments can be computed in space
`O(m/√log m)` and time `2^{O(m/√log m)}`.* As in the paper (before Theorem 2.3), a machine computes
an integer when, given the binary index of a bit position, it outputs that bit.

The formula is turned into its degree-3 network, as in the paper's proof (`ThreeSat/Net.lean`;
each occurrence of a variable gets its own copy, chained to the others by equalities), and these
networks have logspace access at size `s = 8m + K'` (`threeSatFamily`). The rest goes through
residues, while the paper computes the bits directly: a residue form of Theorem 2.3 computes
`Z(G) = #SAT(φ)` modulo every prime `p` with `H(s) < p ≤ s`, the primes of the window have product
above `2^{s/2+1}` (`prime_window`, the elementary prime product bound), and the Chinese remainder
step (`Exact.exists_bitsProg`) turns the residues into bits. Bit positions `j > 3m` are answered `0`
directly (the count is at most `2^n ≤ 2^{3m}`).

This file takes this residue form of Theorem 2.3 as the explicit hypothesis `Theorem41`, for
**every** family with logspace access (Definition 2.1, `LogspaceNetFamily`), with
`H(s) = (2(⌊log₂ s⌋ + 1))^c`, at most `(2 log s + 2)^c`. Everything else is proved here;
`Cross/ThreeSat/Unconditional.lean` discharges the hypothesis with `Net.networkCounting` and
states Corollary 7.2 unconditionally (`cor_9_4_unconditional`).

## Main definitions

* `Theorem41`: a residue form of Theorem 2.3 for every network family with logspace access.
* `BitLanguage`: the instances `(φ, j)` (`Instance`, encoded by `instEnc`) such that bit `j` of
  `numModels φ` is `1`.

## Main results

* `cor_9_4_bits`: under `Theorem41`, one machine decides `BitLanguage` in simultaneous space
  `C (m/√log m + log₂ |input|)` and time `2^{C (m/√log m + log₂ |input|)}` (`SqrtLog m` is
  `⌊m / ⌊√⌊log₂ m⌋⌋⌋ + 1`).
* `cor_9_4`: the same for the bit positions `j ≤ 3m` (all positions of a count `≤ 2^{3m}`), in space
  `C · m/√log m` and time `2^{C · m/√log m}`: the paper's statement.

/-- **A residue form of Theorem 2.3** (paper `thm:counting`, which is stated for bits) for every
family of networks with logspace access: a closed program `R` on `[s, |w|, p]` and constants `c, C, s₀` such that, for every description `w`
of a network `G` of the family at size `s ≥ s₀` and every prime `p` with `(2 (log₂ s + 1))^c < p ≤ s`,
`R` computes `Z(G) mod p` with every value arising in its evaluation at most `2^(C·SqrtLog s)`
(space `O(s/√log s)` and time `2^{O(s/√log s)}`). -/

every family (`Theorem41`). There are a constant `C` and one machine, fixed before the instance,
that given the encoding of a 3-CNF formula `φ` with `m ≥ 2` clauses in which every variable occurs and of a bit
position `j ≤ 3m` (the count is at most `2^{3m}`, so these are all its bits) decides whether bit
`j` of the number of satisfying assignments of `φ` is `1`, in space `C · SqrtLog m` and time
`2^{C · SqrtLog m}`, where `SqrtLog m = ⌊m / ⌊√⌊log₂ m⌋⌋⌋ + 1 = O(m/√log m)`. -/
