# Theorem 2.3 in bit form at a general space bound

`CubeCounting` (`CubeStatement.lean`) is the paper's Theorem 2.3 (`thm:counting`) at the space
bound `SqrtLog s = ⌊s / ⌊√⌊log₂ s⌋⌋⌋ + 1`. Section 8 of the paper (`sec:discussion`) asks
what a faster procedure of the same kind would give. `CubeCountingAt D` is the same statement
with `D s` in place of `SqrtLog s`: one closed program on `[s, |w|, j]` computes bit `j` of
`Z(G)` for every network `G` of every family with logspace access, with every value of its
evaluation below `2^(C · D s)` (so space `O(D s)` and time `2^{O(D s)}` after compilation).
`ThreeSat/AtScale.lean` derives the paper's consequence for counting 3-SAT.

## Main definitions

* `CubeCountingAt D`: Theorem 2.3 in bit form at the space bound `D`.

## Main results

* `cubeCountingAt_sqrtLog`: at `D = SqrtLog` it is `CubeCounting`.
