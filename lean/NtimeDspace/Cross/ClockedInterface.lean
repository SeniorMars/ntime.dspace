# The clocked counter (interface between Theorems 2.3 and 2.4 at an arbitrary clock)

The transfer theorem (Theorem 2.4) for a time bound `t` that need not be constructible tries the
clocks `τ = t₀, 2t₀, …`. At each clock it needs two tests on the accept count of a closed fair-coin
table at the padded time `paddedTime τ` (the length of the coin strings of the block networks at
clock `τ`, `sum_contraction_blockNetworkOf`):

* is the count different from `0`? (membership, at the final clock);
* is the count different from `2 ^ paddedTime τ`? (some replay still runs, for the halt marker of
  `HaltCount`).

`ClockedCounting` asks for one closed program over `[τ, n, b]` deciding whether the count differs
from `b · 2 ^ paddedTime τ` (`b ∈ {0, 1}`), in values below `2^(C·SqrtLog τ)`, for every input of
length `n ≤ τ` and every large clock `τ`. This is Theorem 2.3 at one clock (in space
`O(τ/√log τ)`) combined with the test of Theorem 2.4 at one clock; it follows from the bits of the
accept count (`Exact.clockedCounting_of_clockedBits`). `ClockedResidues` is a residue form.

/-- **The clocked counter.** For every closed fair-coin table `M` there is a closed program `Q` over
`[τ, n, b]` with `0 < Q ↔ acceptCount M w (paddedTime τ) ≠ b · 2^(paddedTime τ)` and values below
`2^(C·SqrtLog τ)`, on every input `w` with `|w| ≤ τ` and every clock `τ ≥ τ₀`. -/

/-- **The clocked residues** (a residue form of Theorem 2.3 at an arbitrary clock). For every
closed fair-coin table `M` there are closed programs `R` over `[τ, n, p]` and `Hp`, `Xp` over `[τ]`
such that, for every input `w` with `|w| ≤ τ` and every clock `τ ≥ τ₀`, the primes of the window
`(Hp τ, Xp τ]` have product above `2^(paddedTime τ + 1)`, the window ends below `(τ + 2)^C`, and `R` computes the
residue of the accept count at `paddedTime τ` modulo every prime of the window; all values stay
below `2^(C·SqrtLog τ)`. -/
