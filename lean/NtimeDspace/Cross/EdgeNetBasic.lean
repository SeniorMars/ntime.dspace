# Edge networks (§2 of the paper)

An *edge network* (`EdgeNet`) has edges `Fin M`, each with two distinct ends `u i`, `w i`, and
vertices `V` with ordered ports (the edges at the vertex) and tables `eval v`; its value is
`Z = Σ_x Π_v eval_v(x on the ports of v)`. This module holds only the definition, so that its clients
(`Cube/*`, the 3-CNF network of `ThreeSat/Net.lean`) can import it cheaply.
