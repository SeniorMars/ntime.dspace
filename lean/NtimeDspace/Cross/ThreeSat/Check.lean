# Nonvacuity checks for Corollary 7.2

* The network read from the encoding of the one-clause formula `x₀` has value `1 = #SAT`,
  computed by `decide` from the definitions (6 edges, 7 vertices).
* The two-clause formula `(x₀ ∨ ¬x₁) ∧ x₁` with bit position `0` is an `Instance` (3-CNF, every
  variable occurs, `m = 2`); it has one model, so bit `0` of its count is `1`.
