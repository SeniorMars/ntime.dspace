# Corollary 7.2, unconditionally

`Cross/ThreeSatFinal.lean` proves Corollary 7.2 from `Theorem41`, a residue form of Theorem 2.3 for
every network family with logspace access. Theorem 2.3 in bit form holds for every family
(`cubeCounting`, CubeFinal.lean), and gives the residue form (`theorem41_of_cubeCounting`,
CubeCounting.lean, with every prime `p ≤ s`). This module discharges the hypothesis.

## Main results

* `theorem41`: the residue form of Theorem 2.3 used by Corollary 7.2.
* `cor_9_4_unconditional`: the number of satisfying assignments of a 3-CNF formula with `m ≥ 2`
  clauses in which every variable occurs is computed, bit by bit, in space `O(m/√log m)` and time
  `2^{O(m/√log m)}`.
* `cor_9_4_bits_unconditional`: the same for every bit position, with an added `log₂ |input|`.
