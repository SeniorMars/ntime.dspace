# The bounded space acceptance oracle `BSA`

Machines are given by Complexitylib's descriptions `Turing.MultiTapeTM.Universal.Desc` (any number
of work tapes, states and symbols numbered in `ℕ`), run by Complexitylib's universal simulation
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.Universal.run`/`simulate`, and every word `w` describes the machine
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.Universal.decodeDesc w`. The machine described by `d` **accepts `x` within
space `b`** (`AcceptsWithin d x b`) when its run on `x` halts with output `[1]` (the bit `true`)
and every configuration reached by a step has a description (`Turing.MultiTapeTM.Universal.eCfg`:
the state, the input head in binary and the zippers of the work tapes) of at most `b` bits.

The oracle is
`BSA = {frame w ++ frame x ++ 1^b : 2^|w| ≤ b and decodeDesc w accepts x within space b}`,
the strings `⟨M'⟩ # x # 1^b` of Remark 8.3, with `frame` (each bit `c` as `[true, c]`, then
`[false]`) as the separator `#`.

## Relation to the paper

This is the paper's definition (Remark 8.3): `M'` ranges over deterministic multitape machines,
and "accepts `x` in space `b`" means that every configuration it reaches, described by its state,
its input head position in binary and its visited work cells, has a description of at most `b`
bits. It gives the two properties the remark uses: a query is answerable in space linear in its
length, and every machine deciding a language in linear space, with any number of tapes, is described
(`acceptsWithin_desc_iff`). The condition `2^|w| ≤ b` only pads the budget, so that decoding
the description `w`, which Complexitylib does within polynomial (not linear) bounds, fits in space
`O(b)`; a fixed machine meets it for all long enough budgets.

## Main definitions

* `NtimeDspace.Oracle.AcceptsWithin`: acceptance within space `b`.
* `NtimeDspace.Oracle.bsaQuery`: the query `⟨M'⟩ # x # 1^b`.
* `NtimeDspace.Oracle.BSA`: the oracle.

## Main results

* `NtimeDspace.Oracle.bsaQuery_mem_BSA_iff`: membership of a query.
* `NtimeDspace.Oracle.acceptsWithin_desc_iff`: a machine computing the indicator of `L` within
  space `s` accepts `x` within any budget above its configuration bound exactly when `x ∈ L`.
