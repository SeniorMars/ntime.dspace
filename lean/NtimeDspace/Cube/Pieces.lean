# Routing pieces and half-routings: definitions (§5.2–§5.3)

A *transport sum* counts, with weights, the maps from a list of numbered *sources* to a multiset
of interchangeable *targets* that meet every target multiplicity exactly. Every source and target
sits at a *place* and has a type; `R p i p' j` is the rule of a source of type `i` at `p` sent to
a target of type `j` at `p'`. We write the transport sum as a coefficient extraction:

  `transport src tgt R = [∏_{t ∈ tgt} X_t] ∏_{s ∈ src} (∑_{t} R s t • X_t)`,

where the product runs over the sources with multiplicity and the coefficient is that of the
monomial with the target multiplicities. Expanding the product, each term picks one target for
each source, and it contributes to that monomial exactly when every target receives its
multiplicity; so the coefficient is the sum, over the maps of the paper (sources numbered, targets
interchangeable), of the products of the rules. Coefficients live in the Laurent polynomials
`ℤ[z, z⁻¹]`, with `z = T 1`.

* `Corner`: the four corners `x, y` (upper row) and `u, v` (lower row) of a rectangle;
  `x, v` and `y, u` are the diagonals.
* `rule`: the rules of a routing (§5.2): a diagonal joins equal types with rule `1`; a side joins
  a type `i` at `x` or `v` to a type `j` at `y` or `u` with `R_xu = (1 - z²) C_{i,j}`,
  `R_vy = C_{i,j}`, `R_xy = (1 - z⁻²) C̄_{i,j}` and `R_vu = C̄_{i,j}`, where `C̄(z) = C(1/z)`.
  A source and a target at the same corner have rule `0`.
* `piece v`: `Π_{x,y,u,v}(z)` for the views `v : Corner → Label` (each view is `(out, in)`, the
  requests the corner sends and receives). Its coefficient of `z^k` is the piece `Π_k`.
* `nUp x y m` and `nDown u v m`: the half-routing sums `N↑(x, y; m)` and `N↓(u, v; m)` of §5.3,
  for a message `m = (η, ζ)` (`η` sent downward, `ζ` upward). A request crossing the row cut meets
  the message at an intermediate type `n`, with the half-rule `(1 - z²) C_{i,n}` at `x`, `[i = n]`
  at `y` and at `u`, and `C_{i,n}` at `v`.
* `transposeView`: the views of the transposed rectangle `(x, u, y, v)`.
* `crossing v`: the crossing `[x = v][y = u]`, where `[x = v]` means `out_x = in_v ∧ in_x = out_v`.
